This is work that I did in Excel during my Data Technician Skills Bootcamp.

## Project 1: First use of aggregate values

This project used the retail_sales dataset: [retail_sales_dataset.xlsx]

In this project, I:
* converted the data to a table
* used the filter function to sort the 'Age' from largest to smallest
* used the SUM function to find the commission total
* used the AVERAGE function to find the average commission

Here is the screen shot of the result:

## Project 2: Use of conditional formatting

This project used the student_scores dataset: [student_scores.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18151967/student_scores.xlsx)

In this project, I:
* applied a filter and sorting to show the best students in each subject
* calculated the AVERAGE for all students and displayed them in an extra column
* used MAX to find each student's highest score
* sorted by finding the best student in the class by average
* sorted by finding the best student in the class by highest score
* use conditional formatting to identify the highest and lowest average scores

Here is the screen shot of the result:

## Project 3: Using Pivot Tables

This project used the Bike_Sales_Pivot dataset: [Bike_Sales_Pivot.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18151985/Bike_Sales_Pivot.xlsx)

In this project, I:
* created a pviot table using the age group, gender and location columns
* used the pivot table to produce a stacked bar chart to show which genders in which age groups had highest sales in each area

Here is the screen shot of the result:

## Project 4: Using Pivot Tables and SWITCH functions

This project used the Product_Sales dataset: [Product_Sales.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18152291/Product_Sales.xlsx)

In this project, I:
* used the SWITCH function to categorise the sales into high, medium and low sales volumes
* used a Pivot Table to show the different sales in different regions

Here are the screen shots of the results:

## Project 5: Showing visualisations

This project used the Bike_Sales_Visualisations dataset: [Bike_Sales_Visualisations.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18152377/Bike_Sales_Visualisations.xlsx)

In this project, I:
* created a line chart for Revenue vs Profit
* created a bar chart to show the Revenue by Country
* created a pie chart to show comparisons between age groups

Here are the screen shots of the results:
